# Pokédex Data Visualisation

## Overview
This is a side project that was completed after graduating from Northcoders. During the bootcamp we were tasked with creating a React-based interface to present data in an interactive and engaging way. What we chose to display and how we chose to display it was entirely up to us. I opted for Pokémon, and this was the result!
